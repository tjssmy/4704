EFE Prompts

1) Develop an Eigenfunction Expansion solution for a 2D electromagnetic problem with a plane wave incident on a perfectly conducting cylinder of radius b centered at (0,0). The polarization is for Ez. Use a cylindrical coordinate system in r,phi and z.

2) Create three plots using subplot for 1) the incident field (real part), 2) Scattered fields (real part), 3) Total fields (real part).

3) Set the aspect ratio of the plots to that of the region. And save the figure as png.
