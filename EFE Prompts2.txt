EFE Prompts

1) Develop an Eigenfunction Expansion solution for a 2D electromagnetic problem with a plane wave incident on a perfectly conducting cylinder of radius b centered at (0,0). The polarization is for Ez. Use a cylindrical coordinate system in r,phi and z.

2) Create three plots using subplot for 1) the incident field (real part), 2) Scattered fields (real part), 3) Total fields (real part).

3) Set the aspect ratio of the plots to that of the region. And save the figure as png.


1D Laplace 

1) For laplace's equation for the function u(x) develop a 1D finite difference solution for the BC du/dx(0) = 2 and u(L) = 0. Create a matlab program that solves the problem. It should produce two plots 1) a description of the geometry and descritization and 2) The solution

2D Laplace 

1) For a cylindrical 2d configuration using r and phi solve the harmonic wave equation with the BC u(r=R,phi) = 0 using finite difference. Create a latex document showing the formulation and a matlab program with 2 figures 1) showing the geometry and 2 presenting 8 solved modes in a figure with 2X4  subplots. 

2) Arrays have incompatible sizes for this operation.

Error in pol2cart (line 23)
x = r.*cos(th);
     ^
Error in WaveCyl (line 77)
[X, Y] = pol2cart(repmat(phi, [Nr 1]), repmat(r_full', [1 Nphi]));

3) The surface plots are missing a slice at the end. Looks like a fence post error.

4) Make the 2nd figure 4 times wider.

5) For the 2nd figure use [777 383 1784 855] for the position and size. Create a 3rd figure that plots the eigenvalues
